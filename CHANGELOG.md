## v1.0.1 - 2025-09-15

### What's New in 1.0.1

#### 🎯 License Scopes for Multi-Product Support

This release introduces **License Scopes**, a powerful feature that enables you to manage multiple products or software applications with isolated signing keys.

#### ✨ New Features

- **License Scopes Model**: New `LicenseScope` entity for product/software segregation
- **Scoped Signing Keys**: Each product can have its own signing keys with independent rotation schedules
- **CLI Support**: Issue scoped signing keys with `--scope` option
- **Automatic Key Selection**: Tokens are automatically signed with the correct scope-specific key
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful fallback to global keys when scoped keys are not available

#### 📝 Improvements

- Enhanced README with License Scope examples and documentation
- Comprehensive AI guidelines updated with scope patterns for all platforms
- Added 6 new tests covering all scope functionality
- Updated services to support scope-based key selection

#### 🔧 Technical Details

- Added `license_scope_id` to licenses table
- Added `license_scope_id` to licensing_keys table
- New `license_scopes` table with rotation configuration
- Updated `PasetoTokenService` for scope-aware key selection
- Enhanced `CertificateAuthorityService` to include scope in certificates

#### 💡 Usage Example

```php
// Create a scope for your product
$scope = LicenseScope::create([
    'name' => 'My Product',
    'slug' => 'my-product',
    'identifier' => 'com.company.product',
    'key_rotation_days' => 90,
]);

// Issue a scoped signing key
php artisan licensing:keys:issue-signing --scope my-product

// Create a scoped license
$license = License::create([
    'key_hash' => License::hashKey($key),
    'license_scope_id' => $scope->id,
    // ... other fields
]);



```
#### 🔄 Backward Compatibility

This release is fully backward compatible. License Scopes are optional - existing licenses without scopes will continue to work with global signing keys.

#### 📚 Documentation

- Updated README with multi-product licensing section
- Comprehensive examples in AI_GUIDELINES.md
- New documentation in docs/advanced/multi-software-keys.md
